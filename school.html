<p style="color:#680C45;"><b> School provides an environment where we can learn a lot of basic skills. Children as young as three years old are taught how to read and write at their preschools. They start to learn the alphabet, numbers, and even do some simple arithmetic problems.ss</p></b>
<p style="color:#68170C;"><b>If you have an interest that you want to be really good at, you need a place where you can harness it effectively. Schools around the world have student clubs that focus on particular hobbies and interests for students who would like to delve deeper into their chosen sport or pastime. </p></b>

<p style="color:#E10D81;"><b>School is much more fun if you have friends to hang out with. These people share the same interests as you, have lunch with your, laugh with you, study with you, walk home with you, and they are there to help you out if you are having trouble with academics or life. </p></b></b>
